1.Features(feature vectors) are the input data we feed into the model to get the predicted output.
2.One-Hot Encoding (categorical values)
--Dummy variables are binary (0 or 1) variables created to represent a categorical variable with two or more categories. For each category, a dummy variable is created, where the variable is equal to 1 if the category is present, and 0 if it is not.
3.types of classification (binary and multiclass)
---01 Classification-predicts discrete classes 
---02 Regression-predicts continuous values
4.Dividing dataset into training ,validation and testing
5.A regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent (explanatory) variables. A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the explanatory variables.
6.SVM(Support vector machine)--creates hyperplanes to separate data into classes .(kernel trick method)

7.sigmoid function (between 0 and 1) used in logistic regression
--logistic regression
